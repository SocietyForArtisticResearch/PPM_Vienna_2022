# Motivation:

::: incremental

- Organize users within portals.
- In education: coordination of a class.
- A portal admin is too powerful for smaller scale use (GDPR, accidents)

:::

# What is a group?

::: incremental

- A page within the RC
- A set of users
- Expositions can be connected/shared with the group

:::

# How to make a group?

- Portal admins can create groups.

# How to join a group:

- RC users can be added by the group admin or portal admin.
- If the group is public, any RC user can also request membership.

# User roles:

- Members
- Admins

# Group members can:

::: incremental


- You can view the group page and connected expositions
- You can create a exposition in the group
- You can request an existing exposition to be connected
  
:::

# Group admins can:

::: incremental

- Set the metadata (title, description, etc)
- You can manage the members or add a new admin.
- Accept/reject request for exposition to be connected.
- Manage current connections
- Control the visibility of the group

:::

# Group admins cannot:

- create new users in the RC
- delete expositions by other users

# Group Page Visibility

- As with all objects in RC, default is private
- Alternatives are Portal or Public

# Create a Group Exposition

::: incremental

- All members and admins can use \[ create exposition \] button on the group page.
- When the exposition is created in the group, it is also connected.
- Connected expositions can be shared, published & collaborated on (like normal).

:::

# Connect Existing Exposition

::: incremental

- Members (& admins) can request other expositions to be connected
- Admins accept or reject such requests.
- Admins can also remove expositions from the group.

:::
